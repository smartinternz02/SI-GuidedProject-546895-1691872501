# Virtual Doctor Web Application

Virtual Doctor is a web application designed for disease prediction based on X-ray images. This application is built using Python, Flask, TensorFlow, and HTML/CSS. It uses a pre-trained deep learning model to predict whether a given X-ray image indicates pneumonia or not.

## Features

- Upload an X-ray image for disease prediction.
- Display prediction results for pneumonia or normal.
- Option to book an appointment based on prediction results.

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.6 or higher
- Flask
- TensorFlow
- numpy
- Pillow

## Installation

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/virtual-doctor.git
Install the required dependencies using pip:

bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Navigate to the project directory:

bash
Copy code
cd virtual-doctor
Run the Flask application:

bash
Copy code
python app.py
Access the application in your web browser at http://127.0.0.1:5000.

Upload an X-ray image for prediction and click the "Predict" button.

The application will display the prediction result (Pneumonia or Normal).

If the prediction is "Pneumonia," you'll have the option to book an appointment.
